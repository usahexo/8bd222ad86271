can I purchase a girl skirt that incorporates twirls into my step","date":"2022-08-17T11:22:12.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  How can I purchase a girl skirt that incorporates twirls into my step?\n\nWhen looking for a skirt to make your steps more fun, twirls are key! There are so many skirts on the market these days with playful twirls in the fabric, which is great news if you’re looking for one to add to your wardrobe. But with all the different options available, it can be tricky to figure out where to start when shopping for a twirly skirt. Here are some tips on how to find the perfect girl skirt that incorporates twirls into your step:\n\nFirst of all, when searching for a skirt with twirls, think about what type of material you want it to be made out of. Cotton? Polyester? A mix of both? There are lots of different options out there, so take into account what would be comfortable for you to wear and what would best suit your needs.\n\nNext, consider the length of the skirt. Do you want something that goes just past your knees or do you want something that’s a bit longer and sweeps the floor as you walk? Again, this is all about finding something that makes you feel comfortable and confident.\n\nAfter you’ve narrowed down your choices based on material and length, start thinking about patterns and colours. Are you drawn to bright and bold patterns or does a more subtle print appeal to you? Think about what will match the rest of your wardrobe and make sure you love the look of the skirt before purchasing it.\n\nFinally, once you’ve found a few skirts that have caught your eye, take them for a test drive! try walking around in each one to see how they feel and how they move when you walk. Make sure they’re not too tight or too loose – you want them to feel comfortable and flowy as you move.\n\nOnce you’ve found the perfect girl skirt that incorporates twirls into your step, enjoy showing it off! Whether you’re dressing up for a special occasion or just running errands around town, feel confident and beautiful in your new skirt – it will definitely add some fun flair to your everyday style.\n\n#  What types of skirts are available that can provide this feature?\n\nThere are many different types of skirts available that can provide this feature. Some popular types include pencil skirts, A-line skirts, and wrap skirts.\n\nPencil skirts are tight-fitting skirts that flare out at the hem, making them a good choice for accentuating your curves. They typically have a straight or slightly flared silhouette and hit at or just below the knee. This style of skirt is very versatile and can be dressed up or down to suit your needs.\n\nA-line skirts have a flared silhouette that resembles the letter “A”. They typically hit at or just below the knee and are perfect for balancing out curvier figures. This style of skirt is also very versatile and can be dressed up or down depending on your needs.\n\nWrap skirts are wrap around skirts that can be tied at the waist to create a flattering fit. They have a curved bottom hem that gives them a bit of swing, which makes them perfect for wearing on warmer days. This style of skirt is also very versatile and can be dressed up or down depending on your needs.\n\n#  How much will it cost to add this extra flare to my step?\n\nThere are many factors to consider when looking to add flair to your step. The most important factor is often how much it will cost.\n\nAdding a simple border or frame around your step can be a relatively affordable option, depending on the material you choose. If you're looking for something more intricate, such as carvings or sculptures, the price will naturally be higher.\n\nAnother important consideration is the amount of time it will take to complete the project. If you're on a tight schedule, be prepared to pay a premium for rush jobs.\n\nFinally, always get several estimates before settling on a contractor. This will give you a good idea of what's available in your price range.\n\n#  Is the process of ordering such a skirt difficult or time consuming?\n\nSkirts are a type of clothing that can be worn by females. There are different types of skirts that are available in the market, and one can order them online or from physical stores. The process of ordering a skirt is not difficult as there are many online stores that offer this type of clothing. Moreover, the time taken to place an order for a skirt is not very long as one only needs to provide the necessary details such as size and colour.\n\n# What are some of the factors that need to be considered when choosing a skirt?\n\nThere are several factors that need to be considered when choosing a skirt. Firstly, the size of the skirt should be taken into account as it needs to fit well. Secondly, the style and design of the skirt should be considered to ensure that it complements one’s personality and attire. Thirdly, the occasion for which the skirt will be worn should be considered so that an appropriate style can be chosen.\n\n# Are there any specific types of skirts that are popular among women?\n\nThere are many types of skirts that are popular among women. Some of these include pencil skirts, A-line skirts, tulip skirts, and maxi skirts.

Once your bet is placed, you will be dealt two cards face-up. At this point, you may either stand or surrender. If you choose to surrender, you will lose half of your bet and the hand will end. If you choose to stand, you will play out the hand as normal.\n\nThe goal of blackjack surrender is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer or by having a higher total card value than the dealer. If the dealer busts (goes over 21), then everyone who still has cards in their hand wins. Note that if both you and the dealer have identical hands (e.g., two Kings), then neither player wins and the pot is split evenly between both players.\n\n#  What is the object of the game?\n\nThe object of the game is to score points by throwing the ball into the opponents’ goal. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n# How do players score points?\n\nPlayers can score points in a variety of ways, including throwing the ball into the opponents’ goal, catching an opponent’s thrown ball, or forcing the other team to touch the ball with their hands.\n\n# What are some basic rules of the game?\n\n1. Only players on the playing area may touch the ball.\n2. Players may not catch or touch a ball that has been thrown by their own team.\n3. Players may not throw the ball overarm. The ball must be thrown underarm.\n\n#  What are the basic rules of play?\n\nThe basic rules of play are simple: each player has a deck of cards, and takes turns drawing and playing cards. On your turn, you draw one card and play one, following the directions on the cards. The goal is to collect as many sets of four cards as possible, and discard them to the side. The first player to discard all their cards wins!\n\nThere are also a few special kinds of cards that add some extra complexity to the game. These are wildcards, jokers, and number cards. Wildcards can be used as any letter, while jokers can be used as either a wildcard or a number card (depending on the game). Number cards indicate how many sets of four you must collect in order to win (for example, an 8 card would require two sets of four).\n\n# How do I win?\n\nTo win, you must first collect four sets of number cards. Once you have done this, you can discard all your number cards to the side (keeping your sets together) and win the game! If you lose all your cards before collecting four sets, then you automatically lose the game.\n\n#  What are the player’s options?\n\nIn the NFL, there are a limited amount of player’s options. Once they are drafted, they have a few choices to make which will heavily impact their career.\n\nFirst, they can choose to sign with the team that drafted them. This is the most common choice, as teams typically offer their picks large signing bonuses to lured them in. By signing with the team, players are agreeing to a contract that binds them to that squad for at least four years. During that time, they will be given the opportunity to prove themselves and may be able to renegotiate their contract with the team or become a free agent if they meet certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, players can refuse to sign with the team that drafted them and become a free agent. This option is less common, as it means foregoing both the signing bonus and guaranteed contract offered by teams. However, if a player is unhappy with their situation or feels they can earn more money elsewhere, becoming a free agent may be their best option. They will then enter into negotiations with teams in an attempt to find the perfect fit while also earning as much money as possible.\n\nFinally, players can choose to retire from football altogether. This choice is also rare, as most players continue playing until they either can no longer or choose not to. However, some NFL stars have decided to call it quits early for one reason or another.\n\n#  When is it advisable to surrender?\n\nThis is a question that has plagued many people throughout history. There are various instances in which surrendering may be advisable, but there is no one definitive answer to the question. In general, though, there are three main reasons why someone might want to consider surrendering: when they have no hope of winning, when their losses will be too great even if they do win, or when it is strategically advantageous to do so.\n\nThe first reason – when the person has no hope of winning – is generally straightforward. If the individual believes that they cannot win and continuing to fight would only lead to more needless loss of life or property, then it may make sense to surrender. This was certainly the case for the Confederate army at the Battle of Gettysburg – after suffering heavy losses and being surrounded by Union forces, General Robert E. Lee decided to surrender rather than continue fighting.\n\nThe second reason – when the losses will be too great even if they do win – can be a bit more complicated. In some cases, it may be better for a group or individual to give up now and avoid further losses, even if they have a chance of emerging victorious from battle. For example, in World War II the Japanese were facing an overwhelming coalition of Allied forces, and so despite having a chance of winning some isolated battles, it was clear that they could not ultimately defeat their opponents. As such, it made strategic sense for Japan to surrender in order to avoid greater losses in the future.\n\nThe third reason – when it is strategically advantageous to do so – can also be difficult to determine. In some cases, it may be better for one party in a conflict to concede even if they have the opportunity to win; this can happen when doing so would result in less bloodshed or fewer casualties on both sides. For example, after being defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, Brutus chose to commit suicide instead of risking capture by Antony and Octavian; his death allowed for a relatively bloodless transition from the Republic to the Empire.\n\nWhile there is no one perfect answer to the question of when it is advisable to surrender, these are three key factors that should be considered. In general, though, it is important to remember that surrender should never be taken lightly; it should only be done when all other options have been exhausted and it is clearly the best course of action.","source":"_posts/What-is-Blackjack-Surrender.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is Blackjack Surrender\ndate: 2022-09-28 14:40:03\ncategories:\n- Play Fortuna\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is Blackjack Surrender?\n\nBlackjack surrender is a blackjack game variant in which the player has the option to give up half of their bet and end the hand after the first two cards are dealt, known as \"surrendering.\" The game is available at most online casinos.\n\n# How to Play Blackjack Surrender\n\nWhen playing blackjack surrender, you must first place your bet.

It has been closed since early 2018 for extensive renovations. The new and improved casino will be bigger and better than ever before. Some of the new features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A larger gaming floor with more tables and slots</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A luxury hotel with 400 rooms and suites</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Multiple restaurants and bars</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A 16,000 square foot spa</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hands casino is expected to reopen its doors in September 2019.

While that may have played a part in the chain’s demise, it’s not the only factor at work.</p>\n<p>Rather, Toys “R” Us succumbed to several structural problems that have been afflicting the retail industry for years. One such problem is the shift to digital consumption, which has led to falling demand for traditional retail items like toys and clothing.</p>\n<p>Another issue is the rise of big-box stores like Walmart and Target, which have driven down prices and forced smaller retailers out of business. In addition, changing consumer preferences have led to a decline in demand for traditional toy brands, while e-commerce has made it easier for shoppers to find better deals online.</p>\n<p>The final nail in Toys “R” Us’ coffin was its heavy debt load, which made it difficult for the company to invest in its stores and compete with rivals. So while Amazon may have hastened Toys “R” Us’ demise, it was ultimately doomed by larger structural forces in the retail industry.</p>\n<h1 id=\"When-is-the-earliest-it-could-reopen\"><a href=\"#When-is-the-earliest-it-could-reopen\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"When is the earliest it could reopen?\"></a>When is the earliest it could reopen?</h1><p>The State Department has announced that it will suspend all operations at its embassies and consulates around the world this week.

If you match three symbols on a payline, you win! The amount of money that you win depends on how much money you put in and which symbols line up.\n\nSome slot machines have progressive jackpots that grow with every spin – regardless of whether or not someone wins! These games offer some of the biggest payouts in the casino, so they’re definitely worth checking out.\n\nThe Biloxi casino is home to some of the most popular slot machines on the planet. With so many games to choose from, it can be tough to know where to start. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, try talking to one of our friendly dealers for advice. They will be more than happy to help you find a game that suits your needs.\n\n#  Players Can't Keep What They Win at the Casino Slot Machines\n\nSlot machines are one of the most popular casino games. Players love the excitement and anticipation of hitting the jackpot. However, what many players don't know is that they can't keep what they win at these games.\n\nUnlike other casino games, slot machines payout according to a fixed schedule. This means that even if a player hits the jackpot, they will only be able to receive the payout designated for that particular machine. For example, if a machine pays out $1,000 for every $10 bet, then a player who wins the jackpot will only receive $1,000, regardless of how much they wagered on the machine.\n\nWhile this rule may seem unfair, it's actually in place to protect players. Slot machines are designed to be heavily weighted in favour of the house, meaning that players are unlikely to win in the long run. By requiring players to receive payouts in accordance with the fixed schedule, casinos can ensure that their odds remain favourable.\n\nSo next time you're playing slots and hit the jackpot, don't get too excited – you won't be taking home any more money than anyone else!\n\n#  Biloxi's Best Slot Machine Games Are at Resource Bay Casino\n\nThe casino gaming industry is a billion dollar a year business.

However, before you start spending your hard-earned money on these games, it’s important to know the rules.\n\nIn general, slot machines work like this: you put money into the machine, spin the reels, and wait to see if you win.

The casino, which shut its doors in February of 2018, filed for bankruptcy in November of 2017. The casino is expecting to reopen with a new look and a new name.\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino is expected to reopen under the name of the San Carlos Apache Tribe Gaming Enterprise. The tribe has been approved for a gaming license by the state of Arizona. The casino will offer Class III gaming, which includes slot machines, blackjack, and poker.\n\nThe tribe has not released an exact date for the reopening, but they are expected to do so in 2019. In the meantime, they are working on remodeling the casino to get it ready for operation.\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino closure left many employees without jobs. The tribe has said that they will be rehiring all of the employees when the casino reopens. They are also offering benefits and training to prepare employees for the new job opportunities that will be available at the casino.\n\nThe San Carlos Apache Tribe Gaming Enterprise is hoping to bring in more revenue with the new casino. They are expecting it to create jobs and provide economic development opportunities for the tribe and the surrounding area.\n\n#  Apache Gold Casino set to reopen by end of 2018\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino, which was closed in March 2018 due to financial instability, is set to reopen by the end of the year. The casino has been through Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is now owned by new management.\n\nThe new owners have not released any information about what changes will be made to the casino or what improvements will be made, but they have said that all employees will be kept on staff. The Apache Gold Casino employs over 400 people.\n\nThe casino is located in San Carlos, Arizona and offers gaming, dining, and hotel services. It is one of the largest casinos in the state.\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino originally opened in 2002 and went through a series of ownership changes before filing for bankruptcy in 2018.\n\n#  Apache Gold Casino closure could be temporary\n\n#\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino located in Tucson, Arizona, has announced that it will be temporarily closed. This closure will affect the casino’s nearly 1,000 employees.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the Apache Gold Casino, the closure is due to financial difficulties that the casino is facing. It is not clear how long the closure will last, but the casino’s employees are expected to be paid during the closure.\n\nThis closure is just the latest in a series of troubles for the Apache Gold Casino. In December of last year, the casino was sued by its landlord for allegedly failing to pay rent. The landlord also accused the casino of creating a “substantial and continuing public nuisance”.\n\nIt is not clear what this closure will mean for the future of Apache Gold Casino. However, it seems likely that this closure could be temporary, as the casino apparently plans to pay its employees during this time.\n\n#  Apache Gold Casino remains closed for now\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino located in San Carlos, Arizona remains closed as of this writing. The casino has been closed since November 1, 2017, when a fire destroyed the property.\n\nNo one was injured in the fire, but it caused extensive damage to the casino. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino is owned by the San Carlos Apache Tribe. The tribe has not yet said whether they will rebuild the casino or not.\n\nThis is not the only casino that has been damaged by a fire recently. The Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas was also destroyed by a fire in October of last year.\n\n#  UPDATE: Apache Gold Casino to resume operations in November\n\nWe are excited to announce that Apache Gold Casino will resume operations on November 1, 2018. The casino has been closed since October 10, 2017 due to a fire.\n\nThe new Apache Gold Casino will feature renovated gaming and dining options, as well as a new hotel. The hotel will have 100 rooms and offer guests views of the surrounding desert landscape.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming our guests back to Apache Gold Casino in November!","source":"_posts/Apache-Gold-Casino-to-reopen-in-2019.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Apache Gold Casino to reopen in 2019\ndate: 2022-10-17 12:23:47\ncategories:\n- Gold Casino\ntags:\n- Online Casino\n- Baccarat Site\n- Casino Game\n- Blackjack\n---\n\n\n#  Apache Gold Casino to reopen in 2019\n\nThe Apache Gold Casino is expected to reopen in 2019.

BetWinner is one of the most respected names in the sports betting industry, and we are confident that they will be successful in establishing themselves as a major player in the online casino market. We look forward to working with them as they continue their global expansion.”\n\nBetWinner was founded in 2014 and quickly established itself as one of the leading sports betting operators in the world. The company has since expanded into other areas of gambling, including online casinos, poker, and bingo.\n\n#  BetWinner In Control of Stardust Casino\n\nStardust Casino went under new management at the start of the week with BetWinner taking over operations. The casino has seen a renewed interest with the new changes, most notably more generous bonus offers and rewards for regular players.\n\nBetWinner is one of the top online bookmakers in the world, so their takeover of Stardust Casino is definitely good news for players.

The deal is expected to close in the coming weeks.\n\nBetWinner plans to invest in marketing and technology upgrades at Stardust, which has been lagging behind its rivals in recent years. The company also intends to expand the casino’s offering to include more live entertainment and dining options.\n\n“Stardust is a great property with a strong brand name and excellent potential,” said BetWinner CEO Itai Pazner. “We are excited to bring our proven operational capabilities and marketing expertise to this project, and we are confident that we can create significant value for all stakeholders.”\n\nStardust is one of Italy’s largest casinos, with annual revenues of around €60 million.

Stardust Casino will be shut down on March 31st, 2019.\n\nThe closure is sure to have a major impact on the online gaming market.

The game is a mixture of Blackjack and Poker. It can be played by one or more players and has a house edge of approximately 1.5%. The game can be won in a number of ways, including having the best hand at the end of the game, landing a blackjack, or being dealt a flush or a straight.</p>\n<p>In this article, we will give you some tips and tricks for how to beat the house edge in Samba Spins.</p>\n<p>The first thing that you need to do is to familiarize yourself with the game rules. In Samba Spins, there are three rounds of betting - pre-flop, flop and turn. There are also five community cards that are shared by all players. The player with the best hand at the end of the game wins.</p>\n<p>To beat the house edge in Samba Spins, you need to make sure that you bet intelligently. In general, you should bet conservatively in the early rounds and then increase your bets in later rounds when you have better hands.</p>\n<p>You should also try to avoid splitting pairs as much as possible as it reduces your odds of winning. If you have two eights for example, it is usually better to keep them together and hope for a third eight than to split them into two hands.</p>\n<p>Another important thing to remember is that you should never chase losses. If you lose a hand, simply move on to the next one. Don’t try to win back your losses by making risky wagers - this is how most people end up losing money in casino games!</p>\n<p>Finally, always make sure that you are playing with optimal strategy. There are many software programs available that can help you do this, such as Casino Verite Blackjack or Optimal Blackjack from Michael Shackleford.Using these programs can help you reduce the house edge down to just 0.5%.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Master-The-Game-Of-Samba-Spins-To-Gain-An-Advantage-Over-Other-Players\"><a href=\"#Master-The-Game-Of-Samba-Spins-To-Gain-An-Advantage-Over-Other-Players\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Master The Game Of Samba Spins To Gain An Advantage Over Other Players!\"></a>Master The Game Of Samba Spins To Gain An Advantage Over Other Players!</h1><p>If you are looking to improve your gameplay in the popular game of Samba Spins, then look no further!

Full Tilt Poker\n\n#  Super Expanding Splashcard Game - the perfect way to spend an afternoon or evening!\n\nSplashcard is one of those rare games that is perfect for all ages. It is simple to learn but provides a challenge for adults, and it is hilarious for kids. The premise of the game is to collect as many cards as possible by splashing water onto other players.\n\nThe game can be played with two to four players, and the recommended age range is from 5 to 95 years old. To set up the game, each player takes five cards and places them in a face down stack in front of them. The rest of the cards are placed in the center of the players.\n\nThe first player flips over the top card of their deck-this is their “active” card. They place this card in front of them, face up. The player then takes a drink from their cup (or pour themselves a glass of water). Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.\n\nIf you are playing with younger children, they will need some help drinking from their cups-you can either help them or they can just take sips between turns.\n\nOn a player’s turn, they draw one card from their deck and play one. There are six types of cards in Splashcard:\n\nCups (water): These are used to splash other players and collect cards. When you play a cup, you must place it next to your active card so everyone can see it. If an opponent has a card that matches the color of your cup, they must give it to you. When you have collected four different colors, you can put your cups together and score a point.\n\nWaves: These are wildcards and can be used as any color cup. When you play a wave, place it next to your active card and announce the color(s) it represents. If an opponent has a matching colored cup, they must give you their card(s). When you have four different colors, put your waves together and score a point just like cups.\n\nJellyfish: These act as obstacles and prevent players from collecting cards. If an opponent’s wave or cup lands on top of a jellyfish, they must give you their card(s). You can also place jellyfish on top of other players’ cups (or waves) to try and make them give up their cards.\nIt should be noted that when playing with young children, jellyfish aren’t necessary-just remove them from the game if needed!\n\nSharks: These are also obstacles but work differently than jellyfish. When sharks are played, the player immediately takes another drink from their cup (or pour themselves another glass). Sharks cannot be removed from the game once played (unless someone drinks all the water out of the pool). \n\nDolphins: These are helpful cards that allow players to take an extra turn or get rid of sharks or jellyfish on their turn. When playing with younger children, dolphins may not be necessary either-just remove them from the game if needed!","source":"_posts/Super-Expanding-Splashcard-Game-offers-limitless-excitement!.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Super Expanding Splashcard Game offers limitless excitement!\ndate: 2022-10-29 03:57:15\ncategories:\n- Gunslinger s Gold Game\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Super Expanding Splashcard Game offers limitless excitement!\n\nIf you're looking for an exciting and unique card game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, look no further than Super Expanding Splashcard.

You can also place jellyfish on top of other players’ cups (or waves) to try and make them give up their cards.<br>It should be noted that when playing with young children, jellyfish aren’t necessary-just remove them from the game if needed!</p>\n<p>Sharks: These are also obstacles but work differently than jellyfish. When sharks are played, the player immediately takes another drink from their cup (or pour themselves another glass). Sharks cannot be removed from the game once played (unless someone drinks all the water out of the pool). </p>\n<p>Dolphins: These are helpful cards that allow players to take an extra turn or get rid of sharks or jellyfish on their turn. When playing with younger children, dolphins may not be necessary either-just remove them from the game if needed!</p>\n"},{"title":"Strategy Card Helps Players Ace Casino Heists","date":"2022-11-01T05:19:41.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  Strategy Card Helps Players Ace Casino Heists\n\nStrategy cards are an important part of the online casino gaming experience, and they can help players ace casino heists.

The answer, in part, has to do with the large sums of money that can be won – or lost – in a relatively short amount of time.\n\nAnd while security measures at most casinos are fairly robust, with plenty of cameras and guards on duty, there are still opportunities for criminals to pull off a casino heist. In fact, many successful casino robberies have been orchestrated using nothing more than a deck of cards.\n\nOne such strategy, known as the “card marking” technique, involves using specially marked cards to identify which hands are likely to beat the dealer. This information can then be used by the gambler to place larger bets or even to pull off a “miracle” win.\n\nInterestingly, there are several variations of this technique that can be used depending on the type of casino game being played. In blackjack, for example, card markers can use different color schemes to indicate whether they hold a high or low hand. In poker, meanwhile, card markers will typically use one or more symbols (such as an ace or king) to identify strong hands.\n\nWhile card marking may sound like an easy way to make money at the casino, it’s important to note that this strategy does have its risks. For one thing, if you are caught using marked cards you could face severe penalties – including being banned from the casino for life.\n\nIn addition, even if you manage to win using marked cards there is no guarantee that you will actually come out ahead in the end. That’s because casino odds are designed to favor the house in most cases – so unless you are very lucky, you may still end up losing money in the long run.","source":"_posts/Strategy-Card-Helps-Players-Ace-Casino-Heists.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Strategy Card Helps Players Ace Casino Heists\ndate: 2022-11-01 13:19:41\ncategories:\n- Betwinner\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  Strategy Card Helps Players Ace Casino Heists\n\nStrategy cards are an important part of the online casino gaming experience, and they can help players ace casino heists.

That’s because casino odds are designed to favor the house in most cases – so unless you are very lucky, you may still end up losing money in the long run.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl6xixsqy0002d4v562ri2de2","category_id":"cl6xixsr10003d4v5hnrpfd0p","_id":"cl6xixsr30004d4v5axcgaz9n"},{"post_id":"cl8a2gibe0000ksv5falt50u1","category_id":"cl6xixsr10003d4v5hnrpfd0p","_id":"cl8a2gibn0002ksv56seq6hwe"},{"post_id":"cl8d1qxye000068v53g50b2y3","category_id":"cl8d1qxyo000168v5hqn9aa4o","_id":"cl8d1qxyq000268v544d42u24"},{"post_id":"cl8e9vxs6000024v5hazwhd1e","category_id":"cl8d1qxyo000168v5hqn9aa4o","_id":"cl8e9vxsi000124v5gr3k3ayi"},{"post_id":"cl8joey6l000078v58wyx4day","category_id":"cl8d1qxyo000168v5hqn9aa4o","_id":"cl8joey6s000178v53eg51cuk"},{"post_id":"cl8l9crdi0000cov5a7j7dn3y","category_id":"cl8d1qxyo000168v5hqn9aa4o","_id":"cl8l9crdu0001cov5cwrc0dnw"},{"post_id":"cl8v32cdt00004cv5h6zlco78","category_id":"cl8v32ce100014cv5cv094e2i","_id":"cl8v32ce500024cv5ha411a2u"},{"post_id":"cl8wlfuuz0000gov54fod8usp","category_id":"cl8v32ce100014cv5cv094e2i","_id":"cl8wlfuv50001gov51uq4e9f2"},{"post_id":"cl8yakf1800003cv5fjut5orc","category_id":"cl8yakf1e00013cv5cacb6f8a","_id":"cl8yakf1h00023cv5bw7f1lt2"},{"post_id":"cl9c9uot50000y8v5dvmv7o4r","category_id":"cl9c9uotd0001y8v5fwlw3v7h","_id":"cl9c9uoti0004y8v5exup20f9"},{"post_id":"cl9dq4ecf0000dcv55ten2zs7","category_id":"cl9dq4ecn0001dcv52zwa7ipg","_id":"cl9dq4ecr0002dcv59z421e1s"},{"post_id":"cl9qnu2ws0000fgv545e20u2s","category_id":"cl9dq4ecn0001dcv52zwa7ipg","_id":"cl9qnu2wy0001fgv5gf0gfmtc"},{"post_id":"cl9rmape900002wv538n4fmt9","category_id":"cl9rmapee00012wv551i4ex27","_id":"cl9rmapei00022wv500qw03d7"},{"post_id":"cl9sx1hz10000aov588op852y","category_id":"cl9rmapee00012wv551i4ex27","_id":"cl9sx1hz50001aov580zn1e4z"},{"post_id":"cl9xrgcbf00000cv5fajv1bpm","category_id":"cl9dq4ecn0001dcv52zwa7ipg","_id":"cl9xrgcbr00010cv52gkw02g5"}],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cl8a2gibe0000ksv5falt50u1","tag_id":"cl8a2gibm0001ksv53rg4db95","_id":"cl8a2gibq0005ksv56rqoemut"},{"post_id":"cl8a2gibe0000ksv5falt50u1","tag_id":"cl8a2gibo0003ksv52e1gaz3c","_id":"cl8a2gibr0006ksv5d0i41pyt"},{"post_id":"cl8a2gibe0000ksv5falt50u1","tag_id":"cl8a2gibp0004ksv53pkvbmsd","_id":"cl8a2gibr0007ksv529s577rk"},{"post_id":"cl9c9uot50000y8v5dvmv7o4r","tag_id":"cl9c9uotg0002y8v506u66s56","_id":"cl9c9uotk0007y8v55jtn15xw"},{"post_id":"cl9c9uot50000y8v5dvmv7o4r","tag_id":"cl9c9uoth0003y8v5gn7b5uxv","_id":"cl9c9uotl0008y8v5akwt788z"},{"post_id":"cl9c9uot50000y8v5dvmv7o4r","tag_id":"cl9c9uotj0005y8v59x0iakmf","_id":"cl9c9uotm0009y8v54moqcfn9"},{"post_id":"cl9c9uot50000y8v5dvmv7o4r","tag_id":"cl9c9uotj0006y8v5e27khw7p","_id":"cl9c9uotm000ay8v57dszc8si"}],"Tag":[{"name":"Swim Skirt Little Girl","_id":"cl8a2gibm0001ksv53rg4db95"},{"name":"Girl In Long Skirt","_id":"cl8a2gibo0003ksv52e1gaz3c"},{"name":"Twirl Skirt Girl","_id":"cl8a2gibp0004ksv53pkvbmsd"},{"name":"Online Casino","_id":"cl9c9uotg0002y8v506u66s56"},{"name":"Baccarat Site","_id":"cl9c9uoth0003y8v5gn7b5uxv"},{"name":"Casino Game","_id":"cl9c9uotj0005y8v59x0iakmf"},{"name":"Blackjack","_id":"cl9c9uotj0006y8v5e27khw7p"}]}}
