#  Chameleon Game Still a Mystery to Many Gamblers

The chameleon game is one of the most popular casino games in the world, but it remains a mystery to many gamblers. In this game, players are dealt two cards and are asked to place an ante bet. After that, they are given the opportunity to either fold or make a play bet. If they choose to fold, they lose their ante bet, but if they choose to make a play bet, they must place another bet that is twice the size of their ante bet.

After all players have made their decisions, the dealer reveals three cards, one at a time. The first card is turned face up and is used to determine whether the player has a winning hand or not. If the first card is an ace or a king, then the player automatically wins and their play bet is paid even money. If the first card is anything else, then the player loses both bets if they have not folded yet.

The second and third cards are turned over and used to determine the rank of the chameleon hand. If the player has a pair of eights or better, then they win even money on their play bet. Otherwise, they lose both bets.

The chameleon game can be confusing for new players, but it's actually quite simple once you understand how it works. With a bit of practice, you'll be able to beat the casino every time!
