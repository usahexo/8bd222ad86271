#  Can You Tell When a Slot Machine Is Ready to Hit Jamaica?

Slot machines in Jamaica can be very deceptive. You may think that a machine is ready to payout, when it is actually not. Sometimes the machines are "cold" and other times they are "hot". How can you determine when a slot machine is ready to hit?

There really is no foolproof way to tell when a slot machine is ready to payout. Some people swear by playing on machines that have just come online, as these machines are allegedly hotter. Others believe that playing near the front of the machine or on machines with fewer players gives you a better chance of winning.

One thing that all players seem to agree on, however, is that you should never play the slots when you are feeling emotional or desperate. If you do, you may end up gambling more money than you can afford to lose and this could lead to bigger problems down the road.

The best way to enjoy playing the slots is by setting limits for yourself and abiding by them. This means only spending what you can afford to lose and calling it quits when you reach your limit. If you do this, then you can enjoy your time at the casino without any regrets later on.
