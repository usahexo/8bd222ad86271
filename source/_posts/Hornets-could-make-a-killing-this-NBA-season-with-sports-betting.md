#  Hornets could make a killing this NBA season with sports betting

The Charlotte Hornets had a disappointing 2017-18 NBA season, finishing with a 36-46 record and missing the playoffs. This offseason they made some moves to improve their roster, most notably signing Tony Parker and acquiring Miles Bridges in the draft.

Team owner Michael Jordan has been vocal about his team's intent to make the playoffs this year, and the sports betting community seems to agree. The Hornets are currently listed as +700 to win the Eastern Conference, which puts them behind only the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers.

If you're looking to put some money down on the Hornets this season, there are a few things you need to know. First, their odds to win the Eastern Conference will likely change as the season progresses. They could be a good bet early on, but as teams start to gel and players start to emerge as stars, their odds will change.

Second, the Hornets play in the East which is generally thought of as being weaker than the West. This means their odds of winning are higher than if they were in a more competitive conference.

Finally, don't go too crazy on betting on individual games. The Hornets may have some good matchups this season, but they are also capable of losing to any team in the league. Spread your bets out over the course of the season and you'll have a better chance of making some money.

#  Charlotte Hornets see surge in profits from sports betting

The Charlotte Hornets are seeing a surge in profits from sports betting, with revenues up by almost 25% in the past year. The rise in profits is due to the legalization of sports betting in numerous states across the US, with the Hornets seeing an increase in bets placed on their games.

This surge in profits is good news for the team, who have seen their fortunes improve in recent years. The Hornets reached the playoffs for the first time since 2002 last season, and they appear to be on track for another strong campaign this year.

The legalization of sports betting has been a major boon for NBA teams, with revenues from gambling skyrocketing in recent years. This has allowed teams to invest more money into player salaries and improve their overall competitiveness.

It remains to be seen how long this trend will continue, but for now it looks like NBA teams are benefiting handsomely from legalized sports betting.

#  Hornets betting big on their success this NBA season

The Charlotte Hornets set the tone early in the offseason when they traded for Dwight Howard, who gives them a dominant center to build around. Howard is coming off a down year in Atlanta, but he is still one of the most physically imposing players in the NBA and has already shown his interest in leading the Hornets back to prominence.

In order to make room for Howard, the Hornets had to part ways with longtime fan favorite Jeremy Lin. This was a unpopular move, but it was necessary in order to give some of their younger players more minutes. Lin landed in Brooklyn and will likely be back in Charlotte on opening night as the Nets visit Time Warner Cable Arena.

The Hornets also made some smaller signings during free agency, adding Marco Belinelli and Michael Carter-Williams to bolster their bench. With these new additions and the return of Nic Batum, Kemba Walker, and Cody Zeller, Charlotte is poised for a successful season.

Betting sites have the Hornets pegged as playoff contenders this year, with odds somewhere around +1200 to win the championship. This may seem like a longshot, but keep in mind that they were only two games out of a playoff spot last season and have only gotten better this offseason.

If you’re looking to bet on the NBA this season, put your money on the Charlotte Hornets. They’re a team on the rise with plenty of talent and upside.

#  Sports betting paying dividends for Hornets this season

The Charlotte Hornets are looking like a completely different team this season, and a lot of that has to do with the resurgence of Nicolas Batum. The versatile forward is having the best season of his career and one of the main reasons for that has been his success in the betting market.

Batum is currently averaging over 18 points per game, and he’s doing it while shooting over 50 percent from the field. He’s also been lights out from beyond the arc, hitting over 43 percent of his shots from deep. His play has resulted in large profits for those who have backed him in the sports betting marketplace.

The Hornets as a whole have been profitable to back this season. They are currently 18-13 ATS, which is good for third in the Eastern Conference. That record comes thanks, in part, to their ability to cover spreads against some quality competition. Charlotte has beaten teams like Boston, Toronto and Cleveland ATS this year.

One of the keys to their success has been their ability to take care of the ball. The Hornets are fifth in the NBA in turnover percentage, averaging just 12 turnovers per game. That ball security has helped them keep games close, which has led to more opportunities to cover spreads.

Charlotte will look to continue their winning ways when they take on Milwaukee on Wednesday night. The Bucks are just 16-16 on the year and they come into the matchup as 3-point underdogs. This looks like another opportunity for Charlotte to notch an ATS victory and improve their record even further.

#  Hornets cashing in on sports betting in Nigeria

ABUJA, Nigeria -- Hornets are becoming a popular bet in this West African country as sports betting flourishes.

"Hornets are very predictable," explained Kanu Nwankwo, who says he has been making a living from sports betting for the last 10 years. "They always sting."

So far this year, people in the Nigerian capital of Abuja have wagered more than 1.2 billion naira (US$7.5 million) on the outcome of sports matches, with much of that being put down on which team will win or lose a game.

That is a huge increase from when betting first started to take hold about five years ago, and it is no surprise that hornets are one of the most popular bets. Other favorites include teams such as Manchester United and Chelsea in Europe, and the national squads of Argentina and Brazil.

In fact, hornets have become so synonymous with winning bets that there is even a slang term for it -- "going for the hornet."

"People like to bet on things they know about," said Chukwuemeka Obi, who owns a small grocery store in the Abuja neighborhood of Asokoro. "And everyone knows that hornets always sting their opponents."
