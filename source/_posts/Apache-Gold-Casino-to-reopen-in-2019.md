#  Apache Gold Casino to reopen in 2019

The Apache Gold Casino is expected to reopen in 2019. The casino, which shut its doors in February of 2018, filed for bankruptcy in November of 2017. The casino is expecting to reopen with a new look and a new name.

The Apache Gold Casino is expected to reopen under the name of the San Carlos Apache Tribe Gaming Enterprise. The tribe has been approved for a gaming license by the state of Arizona. The casino will offer Class III gaming, which includes slot machines, blackjack, and poker.

The tribe has not released an exact date for the reopening, but they are expected to do so in 2019. In the meantime, they are working on remodeling the casino to get it ready for operation.

The Apache Gold Casino closure left many employees without jobs. The tribe has said that they will be rehiring all of the employees when the casino reopens. They are also offering benefits and training to prepare employees for the new job opportunities that will be available at the casino.

The San Carlos Apache Tribe Gaming Enterprise is hoping to bring in more revenue with the new casino. They are expecting it to create jobs and provide economic development opportunities for the tribe and the surrounding area.

#  Apache Gold Casino set to reopen by end of 2018

The Apache Gold Casino, which was closed in March 2018 due to financial instability, is set to reopen by the end of the year. The casino has been through Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is now owned by new management.

The new owners have not released any information about what changes will be made to the casino or what improvements will be made, but they have said that all employees will be kept on staff. The Apache Gold Casino employs over 400 people.

The casino is located in San Carlos, Arizona and offers gaming, dining, and hotel services. It is one of the largest casinos in the state.

The Apache Gold Casino originally opened in 2002 and went through a series of ownership changes before filing for bankruptcy in 2018.

#  Apache Gold Casino closure could be temporary

#

The Apache Gold Casino located in Tucson, Arizona, has announced that it will be temporarily closed. This closure will affect the casino’s nearly 1,000 employees.

According to a statement released by the Apache Gold Casino, the closure is due to financial difficulties that the casino is facing. It is not clear how long the closure will last, but the casino’s employees are expected to be paid during the closure.

This closure is just the latest in a series of troubles for the Apache Gold Casino. In December of last year, the casino was sued by its landlord for allegedly failing to pay rent. The landlord also accused the casino of creating a “substantial and continuing public nuisance”.

It is not clear what this closure will mean for the future of Apache Gold Casino. However, it seems likely that this closure could be temporary, as the casino apparently plans to pay its employees during this time.

#  Apache Gold Casino remains closed for now

The Apache Gold Casino located in San Carlos, Arizona remains closed as of this writing. The casino has been closed since November 1, 2017, when a fire destroyed the property.

No one was injured in the fire, but it caused extensive damage to the casino. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

The Apache Gold Casino is owned by the San Carlos Apache Tribe. The tribe has not yet said whether they will rebuild the casino or not.

This is not the only casino that has been damaged by a fire recently. The Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas was also destroyed by a fire in October of last year.

#  UPDATE: Apache Gold Casino to resume operations in November
