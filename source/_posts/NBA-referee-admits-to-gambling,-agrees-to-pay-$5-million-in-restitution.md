#  NBA referee admits to gambling, agrees to pay $5 million in restitution

In a stunning admission, NBA referee Tim Donaghy has agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In the agreement, Donaghy has also agreed to pay $5 million in restitution to the NBA.

Donaghy, who has been with the NBA for 13 years, allegedly made hundreds of thousands of dollars in bets on games over which he had officiated. Authorities believe that Donaghy deliberately influenced the outcome of some games in order to improve his betting odds.

"The allegations against Mr. Donaghy are deplorable," said Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty in a statement. "This case shows that law enforcement will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who attempt to corrupt our nation's premier professional sports league."

Donaghy is the second referee to be caught gambling on NBA games; in 1985, Darrell Garretson was banned from the league after admitting to placing bets on basketball games.

#  Former referee donaghy admits to making $1 million in bets on NBA games over 10 years

In a shocking admission, disgraced former NBA referee Tim Donaghy has confessed to making over $1 million in bets on NBA games over the course of 10 years.

Donaghy, who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for his role in a gambling scandal that rocked the NBA in 2007, made the bombshell revelation in an interview with The New York Times.

He admitted to betting on games he officiated, as well as on games involving teams that he had personal knowledge of. In some cases, he even placed bets against the team he was officiating.

Donaghy claims that his involvement in gambling went beyond just betting on NBA games - he also placed wagers on college basketball and football. However, it is the bombshell confession of betting on NBA games that will send shockwaves through the league.

"I made money on both sides of every single game," Donaghy told The Times. "My motive wasn't to beat the system or make money."

Donaghy said that his biggest bet was $5,000 on a game between the Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks in 2006. The Warriors won 105-101 but Donaghy lost when he bet against them.

He also claims to have made close to $300,000 betting against the Los Angeles Lakers during their 2009 championship run. However, as with most of his gambles, Donaghy ended up losing money in the end.

In total, Donaghy estimates that he made around $1 million from his gambling activities over a 10-year period. He has since offered to repay this money to the NBA, although it is yet to be seen if they will take him up on the offer.

The admission by Tim Donaghy is sure to raise questions about the integrity of NBA games and throw doubt on the results of past matchups. It will now be up to Commissioner Adam Silver and his team at the league office to determine if any further action needs to be taken in light of these revelations.

According to a report in the "New York Post", Tim Donaghy made at least $30,000 from gambling on NBA games during the 2002-2003 season. The FBI is investigating whether or not Donaghy had inside information on teams he gambled on.

Donaghy, a 13-year veteran of the NBA, resigned from the league in July after being confronted with evidence that he had gambled on games. In a statement released at the time, Donaghy said that he "engaged in this activity only to make extra money and never bets against my hometown team Pittsburgh Penguins or any other team."

The Post's report did not cite any specific examples of games that Donaghy may have bet on, but it did say that federal investigators are looking into whether or not the referee provided inside information to a gambling partner. According to the article, NBA officials are "stunned" by the allegations and believe that they may have been victims of fraud.

#  Judge orders former referee donaghy to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution to NBA

On Wednesday, a federal judge ordered former NBA referee Tim Donaghy to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution to the league for his role in the betting scandal that rocked the sport in 2007.

Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months in prison after admitting to betting on games he officiated and providing inside information to a co-conspirator. 

The NBA had been seeking restitution of more than $1 million, but U.S. District Judge Carol Amon reduced that amount after noting that Donaghy's "financial circumstances have changed significantly since his indictment." 

"The defendant has no ability to pay a larger sum," Amon said. 

In addition to the restitution payment, Donaghy must also complete 100 hours of community service and has been banned from officiating any NBA games for life.

#  Referee donaghy sentenced to 15 months in prison for gambling scheme

In a federal court in Brooklyn, former NBA referee Tim Donaghy was sentenced to 15 months for his role in a gambling scheme.

Donaghy, 41, had pled guilty in July 2007 to two felony charges of conspiracy to engage in wire fraud and transmitting betting information through interstate commerce.

Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 27 to 33 months, but Judge Carol Bagley Amon said she felt Donaghy's cooperation with the government merited a shorter prison term.

"I've never seen anything like this before", said Amon, who also ordered Donaghy to pay a $2,500 fine. "It's very sad."

Donaghy told reporters outside the courthouse that he took "responsibility for my actions" and that he was "trying to do everything I can to put this behind me."

According to prosecutors, Donaghy made picks on games in which he had inside information from other referees about whether they would call fouls or make other biased calls. He then passed on this information to three co-conspirators - two friends and an uncle - who wagered on the games and shared in the profits.

The scheme ran from November 2005 until June 2007, during which time Donaghy officiated 260 games. Prosecutors alleged that he made about $30,000 from his wagers.

Donaghy resigned from the NBA on July 9, 2007, one day after FBI agents raided his home as part of their investigation into the gambling scheme.
