If you're looking for an exciting and unique card game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, look no further than Super Expanding Splashcard. This game offers limitless excitement and provides a truly unique experience each time you play.

Super Expanding Splashcard is a strategy game that is played with a deck of cards. The goal is to remove all of the cards from the table by matching them up in sets of threes. When you remove a set of three cards, the card at the top of the deck is turned over to reveal a new card. If this new card can be matched up with any other card on the table, those two cards are removed from the table. If not, the new card is added to the bottom of the deck.

The excitement in Super Expanding Splashcard comes from the fact that as you play, more and more cards are added to the deck. This means that as the game progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to find matches. In addition, if any cards are left on the table when the deck is emptied, then those players lose the game.

Super Expanding Splashcard can be enjoyed by players of all ages and provides hours of entertainment for everyone involved. So if you're looking for a new and exciting card game to add to your collection, be sure to check out Super Expanding Splashcard!

#  Super Expanding Splashcard Game - the perfect way to spend an afternoon or evening!

Splashcard is one of those rare games that is perfect for all ages. It is simple to learn but provides a challenge for adults, and it is hilarious for kids. The premise of the game is to collect as many cards as possible by splashing water onto other players.

The game can be played with two to four players, and the recommended age range is from 5 to 95 years old. To set up the game, each player takes five cards and places them in a face down stack in front of them. The rest of the cards are placed in the center of the players.

The first player flips over the top card of their deck-this is their “active” card. They place this card in front of them, face up. The player then takes a drink from their cup (or pour themselves a glass of water). Play then proceeds clockwise around the table.

If you are playing with younger children, they will need some help drinking from their cups-you can either help them or they can just take sips between turns.

On a player’s turn, they draw one card from their deck and play one. There are six types of cards in Splashcard:

Cups (water): These are used to splash other players and collect cards. When you play a cup, you must place it next to your active card so everyone can see it. If an opponent has a card that matches the color of your cup, they must give it to you. When you have collected four different colors, you can put your cups together and score a point.

Waves: These are wildcards and can be used as any color cup. When you play a wave, place it next to your active card and announce the color(s) it represents. If an opponent has a matching colored cup, they must give you their card(s). When you have four different colors, put your waves together and score a point just like cups.

Jellyfish: These act as obstacles and prevent players from collecting cards. If an opponent’s wave or cup lands on top of a jellyfish, they must give you their card(s). You can also place jellyfish on top of other players’ cups (or waves) to try and make them give up their cards.
It should be noted that when playing with young children, jellyfish aren’t necessary-just remove them from the game if needed!

Sharks: These are also obstacles but work differently than jellyfish. When sharks are played, the player immediately takes another drink from their cup (or pour themselves another glass). Sharks cannot be removed from the game once played (unless someone drinks all the water out of the pool). 

Dolphins: These are helpful cards that allow players to take an extra turn or get rid of sharks or jellyfish on their turn. When playing with younger children, dolphins may not be necessary either-just remove them from the game if needed!
