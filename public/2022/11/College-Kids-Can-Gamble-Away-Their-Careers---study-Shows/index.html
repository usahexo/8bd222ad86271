        <h1 id="College-Kids-Can-Gamble-Away-Their-Careers-study-Shows"><a href="#College-Kids-Can-Gamble-Away-Their-Careers-study-Shows" class="headerlink" title="College Kids Can Gamble Away Their Careers - study Shows"></a>College Kids Can Gamble Away Their Careers - study Shows</h1><p>According to a recent study, college kids are gambling away their futures by engaging in risky behaviors like binge drinking and casual sex.</p>
<p>The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Georgia, looked at the behavior of more than 1,100 students at 19 different colleges and universities. It found that 44 percent of students had engaged in at least one high-risk behavior in the past month, including binge drinking, casual sex, or both.</p>
<p>Casual sex was by far the most risky behavior, with 41 percent of students reporting that they had engage in unprotected sex in the past month. Binge drinking was close behind, with 36 percent of students reporting that they had drunk enough alcohol to get drunk within the past month.</p>
<p>These risky behaviors can have serious consequences for students’ futures. The study found that students who engaged in high-risk behaviors were more likely to experience academic problems and struggles in their careers later on.</p>
<p>It’s important for parents and educators to be aware of these risks so that they can help young people make safe and responsible decisions about their behavior. It’s also important for young people to be aware of the dangers associated with these activities so they can make informed choices about their own lives.</p>
<h1 id="Inside-Look-at-How-Top-Colleges-Turn-a-Blind-Eye-to-Gambling-Among-Students"><a href="#Inside-Look-at-How-Top-Colleges-Turn-a-Blind-Eye-to-Gambling-Among-Students" class="headerlink" title="Inside Look at How Top Colleges Turn a Blind Eye to Gambling Among Students"></a>Inside Look at How Top Colleges Turn a Blind Eye to Gambling Among Students</h1><p>Athletes and spectators gathered in the stands on a crisp fall Saturday to watch the matchup between two top college football teams. Amid the excitement, many people were placing bets on the game, using their phones to place wagers with online sportsbooks.</p>
<p>This is not an uncommon scene on college campuses around the country. In fact, betting on sporting events is widely accepted and often encouraged among students. And while it may be considered a harmless pastime for some, the truth is that gambling can have serious negative consequences, both for individuals and for universities.</p>
<p>Despite this, many colleges and universities turn a blind eye to gambling among their students. This is often because they are afraid of losing money from gambling-related activities or because they don’t want to draw attention to the issue. As a result, students are able to gamble without any consequences or restrictions.</p>
<p>This lack of oversight can be dangerous, as gambling can quickly become addictive. And when students are addicted to gambling, it can have a devastating impact on their academic performance and overall well-being. In addition, gambling can lead to cheating and other forms of academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>Universities should take a proactive approach to gambling among their students, educating them about the risks associated with gambling and establishing clear policies and procedures for dealing with any instances of problem gambling. By doing so, they can help protect their students from the dangers of gambling addiction and ensure that their campus is a safe and healthy place for everyone.</p>
<h1 id="Harvard-Yale-among-Schools-named-in-Secretive-Online-Gambling-Ring"><a href="#Harvard-Yale-among-Schools-named-in-Secretive-Online-Gambling-Ring" class="headerlink" title="Harvard, Yale among Schools named in Secretive Online Gambling Ring"></a>Harvard, Yale among Schools named in Secretive Online Gambling Ring</h1><p>After a two-year investigation, a partnership of law enforcement agencies from five different countries has announced the bust of an illegal online gambling ring that stretched from Malaysia to the United States.</p>
<p>The operation, code-named “Golden Gulf,” was said to have taken in $US4.5 billion in wagers over the past two years.</p>
<p>Seventy people were arrested in connection with the ring, including 11 people in the United States. Among those arrested were employees of Harvard and Yale universities.</p>
<p>“This was a highly sophisticated and lucrative international online gambling operation,” said New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. “The defendants bet millions on sporting events around the world, generating huge profits for themselves and criminal organizations.”</p>
<p>The investigation began in 2016 when authorities in Malaysia discovered an illegal online gambling ring being operated out of a Kuala Lumpur high-rise. The investigation then expanded to include law enforcement agencies from Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the United States.</p>
<p>Authorities said that the ring was run by three crime gangs based out of Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City. The gangs used sophisticated methods to evade detection by police and financial regulators, including using offshore bank accounts and cryptocurrency trading platforms.</p>
<p>The US Justice Department said that the gambling ring had taken in more than $US2 billion in bets on American college and professional sports, including NFL and NBA games.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Your-Child-Gambling-Away-His-or-Her-College-Education"><a href="#Is-Your-Child-Gambling-Away-His-or-Her-College-Education" class="headerlink" title="Is Your Child Gambling Away His or Her College Education?"></a>Is Your Child Gambling Away His or Her College Education?</h1><p>The average cost of a four-year college education in the United States is now more than $100,000. That’s a daunting number for anyone, but it can be especially worrisome for parents who have children nearing college age.</p>
<p>One way to help offset the cost of college is by having your child earn scholarships. This can be done in a variety of ways, including through academic achievement, athletic ability, or special talents.</p>
<p>Another option is for your child to work while in college. This can help minimize the amount of student loan debt they will have to repay after graduation.</p>
<p>However, there is another option that some parents may not be aware of: gambling.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a way for your child to make money while in college and potentially pay for their entire education. Of course, there is no guarantee that your child will win enough money to cover the cost of school, but it is an option worth exploring.</p>
<p>There are two types of gambling that can be beneficial for students: casino games and sports betting. Let’s take a look at each one.</p>
<pre><code>Casino Games   
</code></pre>
<p>Casino games are a popular form of gambling, and there are many different games students can play to try and win money. Popular casino games include blackjack, poker, and roulette. Each game has its own rules and strategies that can be used to increase the odds of winning.</p>
<p>Students who are unfamiliar with casino games can learn about the rules and strategies by reading books or online articles about them. In addition, there are many websites that offer free tutorials on how to play various casino games. By studying these materials, students can improve their chances of winning money while playing casino games.</p>
<pre><code>Sports Betting   
</code></pre>
<p>Sports betting is another form of gambling that can be beneficial for college students. In general, sports betting involves predicting which team will win a particular sporting event. Bettors then place bets on this team and stand to win or lose money depending on the outcome of the game or match.</p>
<p>Similar to casino games, there are many different sports that students can bet on. In addition, there are numerous websites where students can learn about different teams and athletes as well as the odds of each team winning. By doing their research, students can make informed decisions about which teams they think will win and then place bets accordingly.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Let-Your-Student-Fall-Into-the-Trap-of-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#Don’t-Let-Your-Student-Fall-Into-the-Trap-of-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Let Your Student Fall Into the Trap of Illegal Gambling"></a>Don’t Let Your Student Fall Into the Trap of Illegal Gambling</h1><p>It is no secret that many students enjoy a good game of chance. Whether it’s poker, blackjack, or roulette, there is something enticing about risking money in the hopes of winning big. And while there is nothing wrong with enjoying a harmless game of chance every now and then, it’s important to be aware of the risks associated with illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is not only risky, it can also be expensive. Not only do you run the risk of losing money, you could also end up facing criminal charges. In some cases, you could even lose your student loan eligibility or be deported.</p>
<p>So what can you do to avoid getting caught up in illegal gambling? Here are a few tips:</p>
<p>-Be aware of the risks involved. As we mentioned earlier, illegal gambling can be dangerous and expensive. Know what you’re getting into before you start playing.</p>
<p>-Know your limits. It’s important to know when to walk away from the table. Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>-Don’t let gambling become an addiction. If you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling or feeling like you need to gamble in order to feel happy or relaxed, then you may have a problem. Seek help if necessary.</p>
<p>-Stay informed. Keep up with the latest news and legislation related to gambling in your province or state. This will help you stay on top of any changes that may affect how and where you can gamble legally.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s up to each individual student to decide whether or not gambling is right for them. Just be sure to weigh the risks and rewards before making any decisions. And if you ever find yourself in over your head, don’t hesitate to reach out for help</p>
