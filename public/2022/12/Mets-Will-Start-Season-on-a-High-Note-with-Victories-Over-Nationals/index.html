        <h1 id="Mets-Will-Start-Season-on-a-High-Note-with-Victories-Over-Nationals"><a href="#Mets-Will-Start-Season-on-a-High-Note-with-Victories-Over-Nationals" class="headerlink" title="Mets Will Start Season on a High Note with Victories Over Nationals"></a>Mets Will Start Season on a High Note with Victories Over Nationals</h1><p>The New York Mets will start the season with a bang, topping their division rivals the Washington Nationals in two straight games. This is a very good sign for the Mets, who are looking to rebound from a difficult 2017 campaign.</p>
<p>Right-hander Noah Syndergaard will be on the mound for the Mets in their opening game against the Nationals. He had an excellent spring training, posting a 2.73 ERA in four starts. Syndergaard is looking to put last year’s disappointing season behind him and get back to being one of the best pitchers in baseball.</p>
<p>The Nationals have a formidable lineup, but they will not be able to contain Syndergaard on Opening Day. He will induce plenty of ground balls and get plenty of swings and misses, leading to an impressive victory for the Mets.</p>
<p>In their second game against the Nationals, the Mets will send out left-hander Jason Vargas to pitch. Vargas had a solid spring as well, posting a 3.86 ERA in four starts. He is coming off of a rough 2017 season with the Kansas City Royals, but he should be able to bounce back this year and provide some stability in the Mets’ rotation.</p>
<p>The Nationals have plenty of firepower in their lineup, but Vargas will outpitch Max Scherzer and lead the Mets to another victory. The team will head into their home opener at Citi Field with a 2-0 record and plenty of momentum heading into the rest of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Mets-players-ready-to-stand-their-ground-in-2017"><a href="#Mets-players-ready-to-stand-their-ground-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Mets players ready to stand their ground in 2017"></a>Mets players ready to stand their ground in 2017</h1><p>The New York Mets ended the 2016 season with a disappointing record of 70-92. Their lackluster performance was due, in part, to several key players getting injured. Thankfully, many of those players are now healthy and ready to make a comeback in 2017.</p>
<p>The Mets’ starting rotation is led by Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom. Syndergaard enjoyed a breakout season in 2016, striking out 218 batters while posting a 2.60 ERA. He has the potential to be one of the best pitchers in the league. DeGrom had a more subdued season last year, but still posted respectable numbers, including a 3.04 ERA and 178 strikeouts.</p>
<p>The Mets also have Matt Harvey, who is coming off of surgery to correct Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. Harvey had an excellent 2015 season, but his performance dropped off significantly last year. It will be interesting to see how he performs this season after missing most of 2016.</p>
<p>The Mets’ bullpen features Jeurys Familia, who is coming off of a suspension for violating MLB’s domestic violence policy. Familia was one of the best closers in baseball prior to his suspension, so it will be important for him to return to form in order to help the Mets improve their bullpen situation.</p>
<p>The Mets’ lineup features several potent hitters, including Yoenis Cespedes, Curtis Granderson and Jay Bruce. Cespedes had an up-and-down season last year, but remains one of the most dangerous hitters in baseball when he’s hot. Granderson had somewhat of a resurgence last year, batting .237 with 29 home runs and 83 RBIs. Bruce struggled early on with the Mets after being traded from Cincinnati, but finished the season strong and will look to continue that trend in 2017.</p>
<p>Even though they ended up under .500 last year, the Mets still have enough talent to be competitive in 2017. With players like Syndergaard, deGrom, Cespedes and Familia leading the way, they should be able to stand their ground against teams like the Nationals and Cubs and hopefully make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Granderson-Cespedes-help-Mets-stand-up-to-Nationals"><a href="#Granderson-Cespedes-help-Mets-stand-up-to-Nationals" class="headerlink" title="Granderson, Cespedes help Mets stand up to Nationals"></a>Granderson, Cespedes help Mets stand up to Nationals</h1><p>In a matchup of NL East rivals, the Mets got a much-needed win over the Washington Nationals behind homers by Curtis Granderson and Yoenis Cespedes.</p>
<p>The Mets (40-37) had lost six of their last eight games coming into Wednesday’s game, while the Nationals (43-36) had won seven of their last 10.</p>
<p>Granderson gave the Mets a 1-0 lead in the second inning with his ninth homer of the season. Cespedes added to the lead with a two-run homer in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>“Any given day somebody different is going to step up,” Cespedes said through an interpreter. “Today it was me.”</p>
<p>Zack Wheeler (7-5) allowed three runs on eight hits over 7 2&#x2F;3 innings for his first win since June 3. He struck out six and walked one.</p>
<p>“I felt like I had good stuff today,” Wheeler said. “I think I did a pretty good job of keeping them off balance.”</p>
<p>Addison Reed pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his 15th save of the season. Jeurys Familia was unavailable after pitching in each of the previous three games.</p>
<p>The Nationals got solo homers from Anthony Rendon and Jayson Werth, but couldn’t get any other runners across against Wheeler and the Mets bullpen.</p>
<p>“We just couldn’t mount anything offensively,” Nationals manager Dusty Baker said. “We hit some balls hard, but they weren’t falling.”</p>
<p> Tanner Roark (7-6) allowed four runs on six hits over six innings for the Nationals. He struck out four and walked one.</p>
<p>The Mets are now 5 1&#x2F;2 games behind the Nationals in the NL East standings.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Mets-Ready-to-Stand-Their-Ground-in-2017"><a href="#New-York-Mets-Ready-to-Stand-Their-Ground-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="New York Mets: Ready to Stand Their Ground in 2017"></a>New York Mets: Ready to Stand Their Ground in 2017</h1><p>It was a season to forget for the New York Mets. They finished in fourth place in the National League East Division with a record of 70-92.</p>
<p>However, they have reason to be optimistic going into the 2017 season. Their starting pitching is one of the best in baseball, and they have some young talent that could take them to the next level.</p>
<p>The Mets rotation is led by Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom. Syndergaard had a breakout year in 2016, finishing with a 3.24 ERA and 218 strikeouts. DeGrom was not quite as good, but he is still one of the best pitchers in the league.</p>
<p>The rest of the rotation is solid as well. Matt Harvey had a down year in 2016, but he should be able to rebound this season. Steven Matz and Robert Gsellman both had impressive rookie seasons, and they should only get better in 2017.</p>
<p>The Mets also have some talented young hitters. Michael Conforto had a breakout year in 2016, hitting 27 home runs and driving in 82 runs. He will be expected to carry the offense this year.</p>
<p>Travis d’Arnaud is also coming into his own as a hitter. He hit .280 with 12 home runs last season, and he should be able to improve on those numbers this year.</p>
<p>The Mets may have missed out on Edwin Encarnacion this offseason, but they still have enough talent to compete for a playoff spot in 2017. They are ready to stand their ground and make a run at the World Series</p>
<h1 id="Mets’-Cespedes-GrandersonStand-Out-in-Spring-Training"><a href="#Mets’-Cespedes-GrandersonStand-Out-in-Spring-Training" class="headerlink" title="Mets’ Cespedes, GrandersonStand Out in Spring Training"></a>Mets’ Cespedes, GrandersonStand Out in Spring Training</h1><p>Both Yoenis Cespedes and Curtis Granderson are off to impressive starts in Mets’ spring training. Cespedes has been slugging homers and Granderson has been flashing his glove in the outfield.</p>
<p>The Mets acquired Cespedes from the Tigers last July and he played a big role in their drive to the World Series. He hit .284 with 17 homers and 44 RBI in 57 games for New York.</p>
<p>Granderson, who was also acquired by the Mets at the trade deadline, batted .237 with 26 homers and 65 RBI in 147 games overall last season.</p>
<p>Cespedes hit two homers on Monday against the Braves, including a grand slam that highlighted an eight-run rally in the fifth inning.</p>
<p>“I feel really good at the plate,” Cespedes said through a translator. “I’m just trying to make solid contact.”</p>
<p>Granderson had four hits, including a homer, in Monday’s game against Miami. He also made a nice catch while crashing into the wall in left-center field.</p>
<p>“I’m seeing the ball well,” Granderson said. “I’m just trying to put together good ABs (at-bats) one pitch at a time.”</p>
